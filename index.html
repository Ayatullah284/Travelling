                <h3>About:</h3>
                <p> Travelling is, indeed, very pleasant. It is useful too. By traveling to new places we can know new
                    people
                    and
                    learn many new things. Travelling opens new vistas of experience and understanding for us. When we
                    go to
                    a
                    new
                    place all of our senses (অনুভূতি) and instincts (বােধশক্তি) become awake (জাগ্রত), In such
                    circumstances
                    we
                    can
                    learn new things very easily. Everything seems beautiful and sterling at a new place. Purpose:
                    People
                    travels
                    for different purposes. Some travel for getting an education and some travel for pleasure. Many
                    people
                    also
                    travel for business and employment.</p>
